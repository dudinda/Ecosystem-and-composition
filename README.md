<p>A server process and a client application: an MVC monolith composed with an MVVM monolith. https://github.com/dudinda/MVPTemplate The engine represents the mvp model, but still each wpf window can have multiple view models to navigate inside a window: an MVP monolith composed with an MVVM monolith. MVC o MVVM, MVP o MVVM. Representing an operating system as layers from hardware up to user interface the same model with its processes follows. It can be possible to build the mvp monolith with Razor-engine using the microkernel, then  an MVC will be composed with an MVP.</p>
